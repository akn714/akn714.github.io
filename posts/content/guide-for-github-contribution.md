Hey, let’s see how you can contribute to open-source projects on Github.

Follow the below steps to do open-source contributions.

*   Step 1 : Fork the project repository into your Github account in which you want to contribute.
*   Step 2 : Clone the repository into your local machine

```bash
git clone [your forked repository url]
```

*   Step 3 : Make changes to the repository in local and commit them.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m [commit message]
```

*   Step 4 : Push the updated code to your github.

```bash
git push
```

*   step 5 : Now, open a new pull request (PR) in the ‘pull request’ section of the actual repository.
*   step 6 : Everything is set now, if author of the actual project accepts the pull request then he/she will pull the changes from your remote forked repository to the main branch of the actual project repository.

Hope you have now understood the process of open-source contributions. Now you are ready to do open-source contributions on Github.
